mailinglist
===========

Github as a mailing list  (GAAML)



##The Idea

Allow users to sign up for your mailing list (which is just a git repo)

To sign up up, you need them to auth with github, watch the repo, and keep their auth token 
so you can post new issues on their behalf from an email.

Handle emails set to <org/username+repo@ghlist.com> match the sender, use their credentials
to post to gh issues.
